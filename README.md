Project Statement
Title: Bank Customer Data Analysis

Objective:
The goal of this project is to create a structured database to store and analyze customer banking details. The project involves setting up a database, creating a table for storing customer data, inserting multiple records, and performing various SQL queries to extract meaningful insights.

Description:
In this project, we'll create a database named ineuron_fsda and a table called bank_details. This table will hold information about bank customers, including their age, job role, marital status, education level, account balance, and other relevant details. After populating the table with sample data, we'll run a series of SQL queries to analyze the data.

The analysis will include:

Calculating the total and average account balance.
Identifying customers with the highest and lowest balances.
Filtering records based on specific conditions like job status, age, education level, and housing status.
Extracting insights about customers with negative balances, those without housing, and more.
This project provides hands-on experience with SQL for data storage, management, and analysis, enabling you to handle real-world banking datasets effectively.
